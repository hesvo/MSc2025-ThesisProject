**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent”

**Code:**
def find_max_sum(arr):
    incl = 0
    excl = 0
    for i in arr:
        new_excl = excl if excl > incl else incl
        incl = excl + i
        excl = new_excl
    return excl if excl > incl else incl

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Python function**
Return the full target function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Initializes and attempts to resolve a VSS raw model, returning the unresolved model on failure"

**Code:**
def get_vss_raw(data: dict[str, Any], fqn: str | None) -> VSSRaw:
