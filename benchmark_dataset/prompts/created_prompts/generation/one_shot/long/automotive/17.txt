Your task is to implement a Python function based on a summary.
Below is an example of generating a Python function from a summary.

---

**[Example]**
**Summary:**
"Validates that 'check' and 'base' are known types, then returns true if the 'check' type is identical to the 'base' type or if its name is found within the 'base' type's predefined list of subtypes”

**Code:**
def is_subtype_of(cls, check: str, base: str) -> bool:
    check_type = cls.get_type(check)
    if not check_type:
        raise DatatypesException(f"Not a valid type: '{check}'")
    base_type = cls.get_type(base)
    if not base_type:
        raise DatatypesException(f"Not a valid type: '{base}'")
    return check in base_type[2] or check == base

**[Target]**
**Use the summary below to generate the related Python function**
Return the full target function code, including function signature and function implementation
Do NOT add comments to the code and provide only the code as output

**Summary:**
"Recursively calculates the depth of the first-found branch of children where each node is a `VSSDataBranch` with its `is_instance` flag set"

**Code:**
def count_instance_children_depth(self) -> int:
